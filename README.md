In this course, I learned hardware, software, network, communications, database,and system analysis and design.

Reflection on this course:

-Industry Talk Poster on Career Development

The talk mainly focuses on personal and professional growth and ways to get a job easier as a fresh graduate. After attending the talk, I realized that it is important for me to foster my hard and soft skills such as programming skills and teamworking. Also, we were suggested to update our assignments and projects in LinkedIn and GitHub from date to date to show the application of knowledge we learned. 

 

-Newsletter on Industrial Visit to Petronas and Huawei

During the visit, I found that the employees in Petronas are working remotely for 6 days a week. The shift towards remote work at Petronas clearly shows that the technology could enable people with greater flexibility, efficiency, and collaboration. Besides, I had a chance to see and understand the application of the products invented by Huawei during the visit. 

 

-Video on Industry Talk and Industry Visit to UTM Digital

After the talk and the visit, I learned more about UTM such as the digital infrastructure, networking, and ICT security management in UTM. Moreover, I saw the data center and it brings a huge impact to me because all the database and information of UTM stores in the server room and the server room is monitored 24/7 to prevent any data lost during any incidents. 

 

-Career Talk Report on System Development at Credence

From this talk, I found that system development is an important thing that every Computer Science student should know. It is an important topic in Technology and Information System and will be used in our working life. 

 

-PC Assembly

During the PC assembly, I got my first hands on experience on disassembling and assembling the PC. It was a fun and interesting session and I know the looks of the components inside the PC such as the CPU fan, power supply and hard disk.
